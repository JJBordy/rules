# simple-rules

Basic minimal rules engine, uses yaml input

It is called 'simple rules' because it will have an input and will produce another; non-recursively.

The reason is to help non-technical people to define conditions based on an input and based on those conditions the
output will be different.

The goal is to have well-defined and well explained schema for the conditions.

# TODO:
* add all the built in functions necessary
* add tests for all .go files
* create multiple good and meaningful examples
* publish

In the future should provide:
* able to tell which rules failed and why, which rules succeeded and why.
* output functions
