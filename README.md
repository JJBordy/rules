# simple-rules
Basic minimal rules engine, uses yaml input

It is called 'simple rules' because it will have an input and will produce another; non-recursively.

The reason is to help non-technical people to define conditions based on an input and based on those conditions the output will be different.

The goal is to have well-defined and well explained schema for the conditions.
